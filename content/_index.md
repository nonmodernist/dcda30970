  text: "The internet is inextricably tied to the coming horrors of the climate crisis. It is both a major force behind that crisis and one of its likely casualties."

We live in an era of contradictions: on the one hand, the infrastructures that make digital culture possible now criss-cross our planet and even surround it from space, and the tech industry's massive gamble on so-called "artificial intelligence" suggests that the physical resources dedicated to digital technologies will only increase in the near future. On the other hand, climate crisis is here, fueled by the energy-related emissions created by countries and communities with the most digital connectivity.

This crisis threatens to destroy the digital technology infrastructures we have invested so much in over the past 50-plus years. As the planet warms, power cables melt; as sea levels rise, internet infrastructure is drowned. Power plants and data centers are threatened by unpredictable natural disasters, while the mining required for batteries and computer chips destroys ecosystems and destabilizes global politics. And every new computer and ChatGPT query only makes the climate crisis worse.

So what can we do? A lot, actually, but it starts with understanding our current situation. In this special topics course, students will investigate the connections between digital infrastructure and climate crisis in a solutions-oriented framework. We'll research specific infrastructural problems and think about interventions we can make in our local communities to build both digital and climate resilience.
