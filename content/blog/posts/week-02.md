After our [introductory week](../week-01), the course is organized around the [four classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element): fire, earth, air, and water. We begin with fire because it is the dominant conceptual metaphor of the climate crisis.

In the Western/Christian worldview, fire is a destructive and uncontrollable force, associated with the power of the gods. Prometheus.....



Fire is apocalyptic. As the lyrics of a floating verse from African-American spirituals say:

> God gave Noah the rainbow sign
