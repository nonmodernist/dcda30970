In the [first week of class](../week-01), we did an activity adapted from Ingrid Burrington's *Networks of New York*, a book she wrote because, as she explains, "I wanted to know about the stuff that made the Internet work, where it lived, and how I could find it." The best way to do this, she learned, was to go for a walk:

> This is how I find the Internet, now that it’s been two years since I started looking: I go for a walk literally anywhere in the city. In the span of about three city blocks, I can usually figure out where there’s buried fiber optic cable (and, sometimes, who owns that cable), which devices hanging above traffic intersections are talking to one another, how many cell towers are in the area, and whether I’m currently under surveillance (by the NYPD or a private observer).
