What do you think of when you read or hear the word “earth”? Maybe your mind conjures up an image of the “big blue ball” of our planet—an image we couldn’t imagine until space travel became possible in the 1960s. Or maybe you think of the stuff beneath your feet, the rich black soil of a garden or farm, or the dusty yellow hard-packed sand that begins to dominate as you travel west of TCU’s campus, or even the rich red clay of the Georgia Piedmont and Southeast Asia. (Did you know that red clay is called “ultisol” by American soil scientists? Neither did I until I just looked it up.)

I’m willing to bet that you don’t think of the device you are reading this on. And yet XXXXXXXX
