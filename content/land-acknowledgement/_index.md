TCU is founded on the traditional and unceded territories of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Native peoples from these and other tribes have lived in these lands and across Texas since time immemorial and in the present day. We recognize and mark the painful history of genocide and forced removal of Native peoples, and we honor the many diverse indigenous people still connected to this place. TCU acknowledges and pays respect to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes; the monument of acknowledgement is located between Reed and Jarvis. 

The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes are a confederation of tribes that include the Waco, Tawakoni, and Taovaya. The Wichita people have lived in this region for thousands of years, and their history is deeply intertwined with the land. 

We also acknowledge the many other tribes and nations who have lived in this area, including the Caddo Nation, the Comanche Nation, the Kiowa Tribe, and the Osage Nation.

## Honoring Indigenous Resistance

In this course, we especially honor the legacy of Tawakoni Jim (pictured above with his grandson and son), who [led the resistance against the dissolution of communal land rights](https://wichitatribe.com/culture/history/days-of-darkness-1820-1934/) that the United States forced on the Wichita during the late 1800s.

## Digital Infrastructure & Indigenous Lands

The connections between land acknowledgment and our course on digital infrastructure and climate crisis are profound:

- **Physical Infrastructure**: The digital networks we study exist on and within indigenous lands. Server farms, data centers, fiber optic cables, and cell towers all occupy physical space on territories with deep indigenous histories.
- **Resource Extraction**: The minerals needed for our devices—lithium, cobalt, copper, gold—are often extracted from lands where indigenous peoples continue to face displacement and environmental devastation.
- **Environmental Impact**: The climate crisis disproportionately affects indigenous communities, while many climate solutions draw on indigenous knowledge systems that have been developed over millennia.
- **Alternative Relationships**: Indigenous perspectives offer alternatives to extractive technological models, suggesting ways of relating to land and resources that prioritize sustainability and reciprocity.

## Moving Beyond Acknowledgment

As we examine the materiality of digital culture and its relationship to climate crisis, we commit to:

- Recognizing that all technology exists within specific territories with complex histories
- Learning from indigenous knowledge systems about sustainable relationships with resources
- Examining how digital infrastructures may perpetuate or challenge colonial patterns of extraction
- Considering how technology might support indigenous sovereignty and self-determination
