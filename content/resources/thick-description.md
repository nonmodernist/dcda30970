# Understanding Thick Description


## What is Thick Description?

Thick description is a writing approach that goes beyond simply stating what you observe to include context, interpretation, and meaning. The term was popularized by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, who borrowed it from philosopher Gilbert Ryle. Thick description doesn't just tell *what* happened, but explores the *context* and *significance* of what happened.

As noted in our syllabus, thick description helps us "see each piece of technology for itself rather than abstracted through language." Paradoxically, we achieve this by applying language more richly and deeply.

## Why Use Thick Description?

In our course on Digital Infrastructure and Climate Crisis, thick description helps us:

- Make the invisible visible
- Connect abstract concepts to material realities
- Reveal the complex layers of meaning in seemingly simple objects or systems
- Demonstrate how technologies are embedded in social, cultural, and environmental contexts

## The Layers of Thick Description

Think of thick description as a series of cognitive layers, aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy (as referenced in our syllabus):

1. **Observation (Remembering)**: What do you see/hear/experience?
2. **Context (Understanding)**: What information helps make sense of what you're observing?
3. **Application**: How does this thing function? What does it do in practice?
4. **Analysis**: What patterns, connections, or contradictions can you identify?
5. **Synthesis**: How do these elements work together to create meaning?
6. **Evaluation**: What value judgments or interpretations can you offer?

## Examples of Thin vs. Thick Description

### Thin Description:
"The underwater cable connects two continents and transmits internet data."

### Thick Description:
"The JUPITER submarine cable stretches 14,000 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean floor, connecting Japan and the United States with five landing points. Completed in 2020 by a consortium including Amazon, Facebook, and telecommunications companies, this fiber optic lifeline—no wider than a garden hose—carries up to 60 terabits of data per second between continents. Workers in specialized ships laid the cable using precision equipment to navigate deep ocean trenches while avoiding coral reefs and fishing grounds. The cable's physical presence on the seabed represents not just a technological achievement but the material embodiment of our global digital economy, vulnerable to both natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. When viewed from above, this invisible infrastructure disappears beneath the waves, yet virtually every international website visit, video call, or file transfer between these regions depends on light pulses traveling through this submerged cable."

## How to Write Thick Description for Your Essay

Follow these steps to develop thick description in your research essays:

1. **Start with careful observation**: Document what you can directly perceive about your piece of digital infrastructure
   
2. **Research the context**: Investigate historical, social, geographical, and technical details

3. **Use specific, concrete language**: Include sensory details, measurements, materials, and technical specifications

4. **Layer in multiple perspectives**: Consider how different stakeholders might view or experience this infrastructure

5. **Reveal hidden connections**: Show how your subject connects to larger systems and structures

6. **Make the invisible visible**: Explain processes, relationships, and functions that aren't immediately apparent

7. **Include relevant contrasts**: Compare your subject to other similar technologies or its historical predecessors

8. **Show significance**: Explain why this infrastructure matters beyond its basic function

## Practice Exercise

Choose a piece of digital infrastructure you encounter daily (a cell tower, router, data center, etc.) and write:

1. A thin description (2-3 sentences)
2. A thick description (1-2 paragraphs)

Compare your descriptions. Which reveals more about the object's meaning and significance? Which helps the reader better understand its role in digital infrastructure and climate crisis?

## Remember:

As Dr. Edwards notes in the syllabus, the goal of thick description is to:
- Provide information which gives the reader *knowledge*
- Explain so that the reader can *understand*
- Give examples so the reader can see how this information has been *applied*
- Pull it apart to *analyze* it for the reader
- Put it back together with interpretation, insight, and new knowledge through *synthesis*
- Step back and *evaluate* your interpretation

By mastering thick description, you'll develop a powerful tool for critical analysis that will serve you well beyond this course.
