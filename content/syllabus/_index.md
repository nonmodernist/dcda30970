## Learning Outcomes

Through reading, writing, discussion, and research, students will:

* visualize global digital infrastructure(s) and the materiality of digital technologies;
* analyze how digital culture(s) contribute to, interact with, and/or resist climate crisis;
* write a concise, dense, and well-argued historical, philosophical, and/or ethnographic analysis about the relationship between a piece of digital infrastructure and the climate crisis;
* use digital composing methods to contribute to public knowledge; and
* collaborate to envision the applied solutions we need to address the climate crisis.

The above learning outcomes map onto DCDA's Digital Culture Learning Outcomes, which state that students will:

* demonstrate knowledge of the social and historical context of digital culture.
* demonstrate an ability to compose digital arguments.
* encounter significant works of scholarship and methods for doing research in digital studies.
