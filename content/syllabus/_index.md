Welcome to the syllabus for **DCDA 30970 - Special Topics: Digital Infrastructure and Climate Crisis**. This page provides an overview of the course structure, policies, and expectations.

This course is organized around the [four classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element): fire, earth, air, and water. We begin with fire because it is the dominant conceptual metaphor of the climate crisis, and it is a danger we face very specifically here in North Central Texas.
