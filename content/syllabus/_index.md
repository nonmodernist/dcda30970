# **DCDA 30970**
## **Special Topics in DCDA: Digital Infrastructure and Climate Crisis**
## **Taught by Dr. Alexandra Edwards, Fall 2025**

## *Catalog Description*

*A directed study in Digital Culture and/or Data Analytics (DCDA). A variety of special or one-time topics in DCDA may be covered in this class. The format may vary by semester. 1-3 semester hours. This course may be repeated for credit.*

## **Course Description**

"The internet is inextricably tied to the coming horrors of the climate crisis.   
It is both a major force behind that crisis and one of its likely casualties."  
â€”Kevin Lozano, "[Can the Internet Survive Climate Change?](https://newrepublic.com/article/155993/can-internet-survive-climate-change)"

We live in an era of contradictions: on the one hand, the infrastructures that make digital culture possible now criss-cross our planet and even surround it from space, and the tech industry's massive gamble on so-called "artificial intelligence" suggests that the physical resources dedicated to digital technologies will only increase in the near future. On the other hand, climate crisis is here, fueled by the energy-related emissions created by countries and communities with the most digital connectivity.

This crisis threatens to destroy the digital technology infrastructures we have invested so much in over the past 50-plus years. As the planet warms, power cables melt; as sea levels rise, internet infrastructure is drowned. Power plants and data centers are threatened by unpredictable natural disasters, while the mining required for batteries and computer chips destroys ecosystems and destabilizes global politics. And every new computer and ChatGPT query only makes the climate crisis worse.

So what can we do? A lot, actually, but it starts with understanding our current situation. In this special topics course, students will investigate the connections between digital infrastructure and climate crisis in a solutions-oriented framework. We'll research specific infrastructural problems and think about interventions we can make in our local communities to build both digital and climate resilience.

## **Course Info**

**Number:** DCDA 30970  
**Title:** Special Topics in DCDA (Digital Infrastructure & Climate Crisis)  
**Credit:** 3 credit hours  
**Location:** SCHAR 2003  
**Time:** T/Th 11:00am - 12:20pm

## **Prerequisites**

There are no prerequisites for DCDA 30970. Students should expect a level of rigorous and independent/self-motivated work consistent with a directed study.

## **Required Materials**

Required reading and viewing for this course will be provided via links in the course calendar in this syllabus.

Because this course focuses on digital culture and methods, having a working laptop *OR* regular, reliable access to a computer with the internet is essential. You will need a free [Github](https://github.com/) account. You will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer.

## **Learning Outcomes**

Through reading, writing, discussion, and research, students will:

* visualize global digital infrastructure(s) and the materiality of digital technologies;
* analyze how digital culture(s) contribute to, interact with, and/or resist climate crisis;
* write a concise, dense, and well-argued historical, philosophical, and/or ethnographic analysis about the relationship between a piece of digital infrastructure and the climate crisis;
* use digital composing methods to contribute to public knowledge; and
* collaborate to envision the applied solutions we need to address the climate crisis.

The above learning outcomes map onto DCDA's Digital Culture Learning Outcomes, which state that students will:

* demonstrate knowledge of the social and historical context of digital culture.
* demonstrate an ability to compose digital arguments.
* encounter significant works of scholarship and methods for doing research in digital studies.
