## Course Methods

This course operates at the intersection of theory and practice, challenging students to think critically about digital infrastructure while developing actionable responses to the climate crisis. Specifically, this course is built around:

### Critical Materiality

* Developing the capacity to "see" invisible digital infrastructure all around us
* Understanding the physical reality behind metaphors like "cloud computing"
* Tracing the lifecycle of digital technologies from mineral extraction to e-waste

### Research & Communication Skills

* Practicing rigorous academic research on emerging socio-technical issues
* Developing skills in git versioning to track writing development
* Creating public-facing knowledge through blog posts and collaborative projects

### Justice-Centered Solutions

* Moving beyond both techno-optimism and techno-pessimism
* Centering environmental justice in technological problem-solving
* Recognizing connections between colonial histories and current extraction patterns

### Collaborative Learning Environment

* Promoting "be here now" engagement with complex material
* Balancing individual research with collaborative knowledge-building
* Creating a community of practice around sustainable digital futures

## Teaching Politics and Style

I take y'all seriously as scholars and I expect y'all to take this course seriously in return. 

### Anti-Racist & Anti-Oppressive Teaching

This course recognizes that the impacts of climate change and the benefits of digital technologies are not distributed equally. We'll examine how race, class, gender, and geography intersect with these infrastructures, and consider how to build more just technological futures.

Throughout our study, we'll attend to how these systems maintain or challenge structures of power and privilege. We will prioritize perspectives from communities most affected by environmental harms and technological exclusion.

Furthermore, we will work to create a classroom environment that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. This includes being mindful of language, avoiding microaggressions, and actively listening to diverse perspectives.
I will do my best to create a space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences. I also expect you to do the same for your classmates.
I will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying in this classroom. If you experience or witness such behavior, please report it to me immediately.
I will work with you to address any issues that arise.

I will also provide resources and support for students who may need additional help navigating these issues. This includes connecting you with campus resources, such as counseling services or student organizations focused on social justice. 

### Bloom's Taxonomy: Language for Discussing Learning

In this course, we'll use Bloom's Taxonomy to help us categorize and discuss the kinds of learning you will do. While learning is a lot more complicated than a single chart can convey, I think it's helpful to have shared language around what we're aiming for.

As is appropriate for undergraduate coursework, this course expects that you will not only **remember** and **understand** the material assigned, but that you will be able to **apply** and **analyze** what you learn. Because this is a 30000-level course/directed study, you will further be asked to stretch your skills and capabilities by **evaluating** and **creating**.

This means that, at minimum, you must have done the assigned homework before you come to class. You cannot **remember** nor **understand** what you have not even looked at.

If it becomes obvious that you cannot participate in class due to lack of preparation, you may be asked to leave and counted as absent for the day. See "Attendance & Participation" in the Assignments section for more details.
