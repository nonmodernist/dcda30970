## Student Access & Accommodations

If you need an accommodation to ensure you can succeed in this course, please let me know as soon as you can, and I will work with you on implementing it.

{{ divider() }}

Texas Christian University affords students with disabilities reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. To be eligible for disability-related academic accommodations, students are required to register with the TCU Office of Student Access and Accommodation and have their requested accommodations evaluated. If approved for accommodations, students are required to discuss their official TCU Notification of Accommodation with their instructors. Accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement. The Office of Student Access and Accommodation is located in The Harrison, Suite 1200. More information on how to apply for accommodations can be found at [TCU Student Access & Accommodation Services](https://www.tcu.edu/access-accommodation/) or by calling Student Access and Accommodation at (817) 257-6567.

## Late Assignments

I do not give penalties or take off points for turning in assignments late. However, I will not provide written feedback on assignments turned in late. If you need feedback on a late assignment, please meet with me during office hours.

All late and make-up assignments must be turned in by the last regular day of class to receive credit.

## Absences

Attendance is required and contributes to your final grade. You are responsible for learning what you missed while absent and for keeping up with the reading and assignments. Please don't email me asking, "What did I miss?" Check the syllabus, the blog, and my weekly notes, and ask your classmates.

Students who miss important deadlines for [University-excused absences](https://deanofstudents.tcu.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies/attendance-expectations-office-absence-policy/) should contact me as soon as possible.

Please do not send me medical documentation relating to your absences.

## Grade Concerns

If you would like to discuss evaluations of assignments, please make an appointment with me no sooner than 24 hours after receiving assessment/feedback to ensure adequate time to review my comments and to identify areas of concern. TCU's official grade appeal procedure can be found [here](https://deanofstudents.tcu.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies/grade-appeal-procedure/).

## "Be Here Now"

When you enter our classroom, you're joining a temporary but important community of thinkers. Your full presence matters—not just physically, but mentally and emotionally too. When someone works on unrelated assignments or scrolls through social media during class, it affects our collective experience in several ways:

* It divides your attention and reduces what you gain from the session
* It subtly communicates to others that what's happening in class isn't worthy of full attention
* It disrupts the collaborative atmosphere we're working to build
* It can make your classmates and me feel that our contributions aren't valued

I understand that life gets complicated:

* If you're dealing with an emergency that requires your attention via phone/email during class, just give me a quick heads-up.
* If you're struggling to stay engaged because of personal challenges, come talk to me during office hours—I'm here to help.

What makes this class special (topics) isn't just the material—it's the unique combination of perspectives that only happens when this specific group of people engages together. Your contributions matter. Your questions spark insights for others. Your attention creates a space where everyone feels valued.
