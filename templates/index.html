            <p>We live in an era of contradictions: on the one hand, the infrastructures that make digital culture possible now criss-cross our planet and even surround it from space, and the tech industry's massive gamble on so-called "artificial intelligence" suggests that the physical resources dedicated to digital technologies will only increase in the near future. On the other hand, climate crisis is here, fueled by the energy-related emissions created by countries and communities with the most digital connectivity.</p>
            
            <p>This crisis threatens to destroy the digital technology infrastructures we have invested so much in over the past 50-plus years. As the planet warms, power cables melt; as sea levels rise, internet infrastructure is drowned. Power plants and data centers are threatened by unpredictable natural disasters, while the mining required for batteries and computer chips destroys ecosystems and destabilizes global politics.</p>
            
            <p>So what can we do? A lot, actually, but it starts with understanding our current situation. In this special topics course, students will investigate the connections between digital infrastructure and climate crisis in a solutions-oriented framework.</p>

            <h2>Course Philosophy</h2>
            <p>This course operates at the intersection of theory and practice, challenging students to think critically about digital infrastructure while developing actionable responses to the climate crisis. Specifically, the course is built around the following four methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Critical Materiality</li>
              <li>Research and Communication Skills</li>
              <li>Justice-Centered Solutions</li>
              <li>Collaborative Learning</li>
            </ul>

The birds are silhouetted against a dramatic gradient background that transitions from deep blue at the top to vibrant orange at the bottom. The tower features yellow rectangular panels and copper-colored metal components. The illustration has a stylized, graphic quality with a textured, grainy overlay that gives it a vintage poster-like appearance.">

                <p>This image is based on something I saw on campus last year: three crows perched on the cell signal repeater on top of Jarvis.</p>
                <p>I think of these three crows as sentinels for our class. Like ravens in ancient stories who carried messages between worlds, these birds watch over our work from their technological roost. They eavesdrop on our conversations.</p>

                    <p>TCU is founded on the traditional and unceded territories of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The digital networks we study exist on indigenous lands, and the minerals needed for our devices are often extracted from territories where indigenous peoples continue to face displacement and environmental devastation.</p>
